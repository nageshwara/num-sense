# Number Sense - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Create a Next.js application that teaches number sense to kindergartners using visual 2D blocks representation (Number Blocks). The app will represent numbers up to 4 digits (9999) and show their real value.

## Component Architecture

### Page Structure
1. Main page (`/`) - Navigation hub with mode selection
2. Free Exploration (`/explore`) - Render any number as blocks
3. Skip Counting (`/skip-counting`) - Animated counting by given intervals
4. Addition (`/addition`) - Visualize adding two numbers with blocks
5. Subtraction (`/subtraction`) - Visualize subtraction with blocks
6. Quiz (`/quiz`) - Practice with random problems based on difficulty

### Reusable Components
1. `NumberBlocks` - Renders blocks representation of numbers
2. `NumberInput` - Validated input for entering numbers
3. `AnimationController` - Controls animation timing and sequences
4. `DifficultySelector` - For quiz mode level selection
5. `Navigation` - For moving between modes

## Implementation Steps

1. **Setup Project Structure**
   - Create component directories and page layouts
   - Set up Tailwind CSS configurations

2. **Implement Core Number Block Component**
   - Create logic to render numbers as visual blocks
   - Implement different block sizes (1s, 10s, 100s, 1000s)

3. **Build Mode Pages**
   - Implement Free Exploration mode with real-time rendering
   - Create Skip Counting with animation sequences
   - Develop Addition visualization with step animations
   - Build Subtraction visualization with step animations
   - Create Quiz mode with difficulty levels and scoring

4. **Add Animations and Transitions**
   - Implement CSS animations for number transformations
   - Add visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers

5. **Polish UI/UX**
   - Create kid-friendly interface with large UI elements
   - Add audio feedback
   - Implement responsive design for different devices

## Testing
- Test with target age group if possible
- Ensure animations work across browsers
- Validate educational effectiveness

## Deployment
- Deploy to Vercel for easy access
