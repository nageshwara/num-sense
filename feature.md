build a html application to teach math to kindergartners. the goal is to teach numbers upto 4 digits 9999, show what their real value is and how they are connected to each other. the idea is to show numbers in 2d blocks 
    (Number blocks). A 100 would be a 10x10 array of blocks. A 10 would be a single array of 10 blocks. I want below modes. mode 1: free exploration, user can give any number and it is rendered in blocks on the screen. mode 2: 
    skip counting. user gives a number eg: 5. the animation shows 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 so on (both digits and blocks). use modern css animations transformations. mode 3: given two numbers, show the animation of adding them. if 10, 
  55 is given, show 10 in blocks and 55 in blocks and then show the animation of adding them up. and show the result as 65. mode 4: given two numbers, show the animation of subtraction. mode 5: this is quiz. you ask additions 
  and subtractions randomly based on their choice and level of difficulty. Prepare a plan and a step-by-step task to execute and work through them. I prefer this to be a nextjs app so that it can be deployed easily.

use typescript, pnpm, tailwindcss
